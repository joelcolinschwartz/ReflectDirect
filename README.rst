ReflectDirect
=============

**Your Jupyter stage for reflected light from directly imaged planets**


ReflectDirect is a Python suite created to explore exoplanetary systems in Jupyter notebooks. Design a planet's look and layout, view it close up or observe it from afar, examine where light strikes it and more. The code is well documented, and there's a demo notebook to get you started.
